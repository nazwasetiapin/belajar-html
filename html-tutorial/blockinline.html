<body>


    <!--Block-level Elements-->
<p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>


    <!--Inline Elements-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

<p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
